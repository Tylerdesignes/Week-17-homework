            <h2>Best Friends</h2>
            <p>We believe taking a simplified approach at redesigning our nonprofit site for Best Friends Animal Society will achieve better traffic spent per page resulting on higher donation revenue.

                Best Friends Animal Society was designed to achieve finding pets homes, by educating people while also generation donations. We have observed that our product or service may not be as organized or easily approachable, which is causing some user confusion and therefore not retaining users for long enough to become educated or willing to donate. How might we improve Best Friends Animal Society (site) so that our customers are successful based increase of time spent on each page?
